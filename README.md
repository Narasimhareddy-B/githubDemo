Understand the problem: Begin by thoroughly understanding the problem you're trying to solve. Define the problem statement, determine the target variable you want to predict, and gather any additional information or requirements.

Collect and preprocess data: Gather the relevant data for your problem. This may involve data collection, data acquisition, or using existing datasets. Preprocess the data to ensure it's in a suitable format for training. This step may include data cleaning, handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming the data if necessary.

Split the data: Divide your dataset into training and testing subsets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. You may also consider using a validation set for hyperparameter tuning, but for simplicity, we'll focus on a train-test split.

Select a model: Narasimha_model_v1-> Logistic Regression

 Choose a classification algorithm that suits your problem. Some popular algorithms include logistic regression and KNN. Consider the characteristics of your data, such as the number of features, the size of the dataset, and the interpretability requirements, when selecting a model.

Train the model: Use the training data to train your selected model. The model will learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable. 

Evaluate the model: Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance on the testing set. Common evaluation metrics for classification problems include accuracy,
